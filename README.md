NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS FOR AMEX!

1) Download an AMEX statement as a CSV and put it in the folder with the main method.
2) Run the script
3) You will see all the filtered charged by TFL.

This initial build should make it easier to sort through your credit card statement to ask for refunds. This was created due to the TFL cyber attack which halted refunds for 3 months. The next update will automatically go through multiple CSV files and compile the results 
in another CSV file.
